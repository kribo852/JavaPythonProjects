# JavaPythonProjects

a small repo for small java projects and examples
I thougth I'd make a small repo with some mini projects/examples that are contained in one file each.

ideally, it will contain a few examples in Java and Python. 

The examples included are:

1 SENET boardgame(python) \n
2 calculate pi(java) using "trapetzoids/rectangleoids" \n
2 calculate pi(java) using Monte Carlo integration as well as by calculating circumference of a circle  \n
3 a map clustering algorithm(Java) that chunks pieces of terrain together in a 2D map\n
