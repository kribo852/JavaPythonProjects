# JavaPythonProjects

a repo for java or python projects
I thougth I'd make a small repo with some mini projects that are one file each.

ideally, it will contain a few examples in Java and Python. 

The examples included are:

1 SENET boardgame(python)
2 calculate pi(python)
3 a map clustering algorithm(Java) that chunks pieces of terrain together
