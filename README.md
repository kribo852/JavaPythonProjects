# JavaPythonProjects

a repo for java or python projects
I thougth I'd make a small repo with some mini project.

ideally, it will contain a few examples in java and python. I also thought about making examples in a third language but I have not decided yet. 

the examples I want to include is:

1 SENET boardgame(python)
2 calculate pi(python)
3 generic map editor(Java)
4 minimalistic tool for drawing sprites for games(java)
5 small space explorer game(python)

In case of mania, I might try to port some of these so that they are implemented in both languages.
