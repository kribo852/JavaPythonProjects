# JavaPythonProjects

a repo for java or python projects
I thougth I'd make a small repo with some mini project.

ideally, it will contain a few examples in java and python. I also thought about making examples in a third language but I have not decided yet. 

the examples I want to include is:

1SENET boardgame(python)
2calculate pi(python)
